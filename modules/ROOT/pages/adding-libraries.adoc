When building connectors with dependencies that cannot be bundled within the same JAR, you can instruct Anypoint Studio to prompt users to add the files to your connector.

To add native libraries and JAR files to a build:

. Add a file to trigger this feature -  the connector must have one file per configuration at this path:
+
`<root_connector_folder>src/main/resources/META-INF/<connector_name>-<configElementName>-required-libs.xml`
+
. Ensure that the *-required-libs.xml* file contains a namespace, require, and jar tags.
+
For example:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<namespace xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tooling.attributes" xmlns:mule="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core">
    <require>
       <jar name="PeopleSoft Java Object Adapter (psjoa-1.0.jar)"
fileName="psjoa(.*)\.jar" targetFolder="/lib/peoplesoft"
targetRuntimeFolder="/plugins" className="psft.pt8.joa.IPSMessage"/>
    </require>
</namespace>
----
+
In this example, for the PeopleSoft connector, the *jar* element contains these attributes:
+
*name*: The JAR name to display in the Anypoint Studio prompt.
+
*fileName*: Filter to apply to the selected JAR to verify that it's the required one. This matches the actual file name of the JAR.
+
*targetFolder*: Folder in the project where to copy the JAR.
+
*targetRuntimeFolder*: Folder to put the runtime.
+
*className*:  Filter to apply to the JAR to verify that it's the required one. This looks for the declared class inside the selected JAR. The class name must be the full-qualified name of the class.
+
. Specifying a required libraries XML file causes Anypoint Studio to modify your configuration description so that Studio displays an option for installing libraries:

NOTE: If a library is not required for a particular configuration, do not create a required-libs.xml file for that configuration.
