= HTTP Callbacks

Many public APIs use callbacks to notify API consumers of specific events. For example, after a phone call Twilio performs an HTTP request to a specified URL to pass information about the status of the call.

DevKit provides a special data type to facilitate invocation of a Mule flow when an HTTP callback is received.

== The HTTPCallback Interface

To return a status, DevKit creates an HTTP inbound endpoint for your connector:

[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.mule.api.annotations.Connector;
import org.mule.api.annotations.Processor;
import org.mule.api.callback.HttpCallback;
@Connector(name = "callback")
public class HttpCallbackTest
{
   @Processor public void doA(HttpCallback onEventX, HttpCallback onEventY)
   {
      String urlEventX = onEventX.getUrl();
      String urlEventY = onEventY.getUrl();
----

The `HTTPCallback` interface acquires this inbound endpoint via a single method. When the callback is received, the enpdoint references another flow in the Mule configuration file.

Note that the flows referenced do not have an inbound endpoint:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="doA">
   <callback:do-a on-event-x-flow-ref="flowToExecuteOnEventX"
             do-a on-event-x-flow-ref="flowToExecuteOnEventX"/>
</flow>

<flow name="flowToExecuteOnEventX">
   <component class="org.mule.devkit.it.ComponentX"/>
</flow>

<flow name="flowToExecuteOnEventY">
   <component class="org.mule.devkit.it.ComponentY"/>
</flow>
----

== Advanced Configuration

The table below lists advanced `HTTPCallback` attributes that you can use in the Mule configuration file:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute Name |Description
|`localPort` |Use to create the HTTP inbound endpoint. Defaults to environment variable `http.port`
|`remotePort` |The public port to use to construct the public URL to be sent to the external system. Defaults to environment variable `http.port`
|`domain` |Use to construct the the public URL to send to the external system. Defaults to environment variable `fullDomain`
|`async` |Possible values are `true` or `false` depending on whether the callback flow should be executed asynchronously or not. Defaults to `true`
|===

The example below illustrates how to use the optional, in-flow `HTTPCallback` attributes.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<callback:config>
   <callback:http-callback-config domain="www.mydomain.com"
                localPort="8080" remotePort="80" async="false" />
</callback:config>
----

== How It Works

Behind the scenes, DevKit creates a Mule flow containing a message processor that invokes the desired flow. By default, DevKit wraps this processor in an async message processor chain. (You can override this behavior using the `async` attribute as described in the table above.)

DevKit builds the URL of the HTTP inbound endpoint using `localhost` as host and the `http.port` environment variable, or the value of `localPort`, as port. The path of the URL is a random string.

The URL that is passed to the external system is identical to the URL of the HTTP inbound endpoint, except that the host is replaced by the `domain` setting (or its default value) and the port is replaced by the `remotePort` setting (or its default value).
