Query Pagination comes as a need when dealing with a high quantity of records. The main advantage is performance as Mule runtime partially processes chunks of records at a time instead of trying to process all the records in memory at the same time.

[NOTE]
To implement pagination in your connector, ensure that the *service's API* to which you want to connect *provides pagination* functionality.

[NOTE]
Be aware that enabling pagination on your connector may break backward compatibility with older Mule versions (prior to Mule Runtime 3.5.x) as it might change the returned type of a processor.

== Enabling Pagination

Enabling pagination in your connector is fairly straightforward. There are only three required conditions that your `@Processor` method must meet:

. Annotate the method with `@Paged`
. Must receive a parameter with type `org.mule.api.streaming.PagingConfiguration`
. The return type must be a `ProviderAwarePagingDelegate`

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Paged
@Processor
    public ProviderAwarePagingDelegate query(String query, final PagingConfiguration pagingConfiguration) throws Exception
{
    return new CustomPagingDelegate(query,pagingConfiguration);
}

public QueryResult executeQuery(String query, String nextItem) throws Exception {
        myServiceClient.query(query,nextItem);
}
----

*Note*: The difference between the `@Processor` method and the operation `executeQuery`. The processor returns a `PagingDelegate` that later on (when retrieving a page) receives a connector instance already connected and executes `executeQuery` accordingly.

== Creating a CustomPagingDelegate

The `ProviderAwarePagingDelegate` is where the pagination happens. Take a look at the `ProviderAwarePagingDelegate` abstract class, which requires two type arguments (T and P in this case). In the class definition below, T represents the data to be returned and P represents the provider of the data, your Anypoint Connector.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public abstract class ProviderAwarePagingDelegate<T, P> implements Closeable

{
    /**
     * Returns the next page of items. If the return value is
     * <code>null</code> or an empty list, then it means
     * no more items are available
     *
     * @param provider The provider to be used to do the query.
     * You can assume this provider is already properly initialised
     * @return a populated list of elements. <code>null</code>
     * or an empty list, then it means no more items are available
     * @throws Exception
     */
    public abstract List<T> getPage(P provider) throws Exception;

    /**
     * Returns the total amount of items in the non-paged result set.
     * In some scenarios, it might not be possible or
     * convenient to actually retrieve this value. -1 is
     * returned in such a case.
     *
     * @param provider The provider to be used to do the query.
     * You can assume this provider is already properly initialised.
     */
    public abstract int getTotalResults(P provider) throws Exception;

    /**
     * Close whatever external resource you might use
     */
    @Override
    public void close() throws MuleException;

}
----

Note again that when executing the methods `getPage(P provider)` and `getTotalResults(P provider)`, Anypoint Connector DevKit  picks the correct instance of your connector out of the connection pool.

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
 * Example of Paging Delegate implementation
 */
public class CustomPagingDelegate extends ProviderAwarePagingDelegate<Item,CustomConnector> {
    List<Item> cachedPage;
    String query;
    String nextItem;
    int totalItems = -1;

    public CustomPagingDelegate(String query, PagingConfiguration pagingConfiguration) {
        this.query = query;
    }

    @Override
    public List<Item> getPage(CustomConnector provider) throws Exception {
        if (cachedPage != null) return cachedPage;
        QueryResult queryResult = provider.executeQuery(query,nextItem);
        nextItem = queryResult.nextItem();
        return queryResult.items();
    }
    @Override
    public int getTotalResults(CustomConnector provider) throws Exception {
        if (totalItems != -1) return totalItems;
        QueryResult queryResult = provider.executeQuery(query,nextItem);
        nextItem = queryResult.nextItem();
        totalItems = queryResult.totalItemsCount();
        cachedPage = queryResult.items();
        return totalItems;
    }
    @Override
    public void close() throws MuleException {
        //Close whatever external resource you might use
    }
}
----

To create your own version of `ProviderAwarePagingDelegate`, you must extend it. Below is an example of a simple extension of this class:
