= Creating a Connector Project
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This document describes how to use Maven and our IDE of choice (IntelliJ or Eclipse/Mule Studio) to create a new Anypoint connector project. DevKit relies on Maven to create the initial structure for a new connector project and to build the project as you develop it.


== Assumptions

This document assumes you have installed Maven with Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Mule Studio to use as your IDE.

== Creating a New Connector Project using Maven

DevKit comes with a http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype] for Mule connectors. Using this archetype, you can create a new project that follows the proper folder structure and that already includes class skeletons containing some predefined elements. This archetype also helps Maven set up all necessary dependencies for a custom connector.

To create your new connector project, you can either use Maven through your Java IDE, or use it directly through the command line. The tabs below describe IDE-specific instructions for creating your new connector project.

[WARNING]
The recommended method for creating a connector project is to use the command line and then import the project into your IDE of choice.

=== Command Line and Studio

From a macro level, creating a new project involves three steps:

. *generating* the project from the command line
. *importing* the project into your IDE
. *updating* the Maven `pom.xml` file

[discrete]
==== Generating a Project Using Maven

. Open a Terminal or Command Line console.
. From within the directory in which you want to create your new project, run the following command to generate a project from an archetype. Adjust the parameters of the command according to the table below.
+
[TIP]
To easily import the archetype-generated project into Studio, run the Maven `generate` command below with your current working directory set to your Mule Studio workspace folder. This ensures that Studio stores the project files in the workspace.

|archetypeArtifactId |mule-devkit-archetype-cloud-connector |
|archetypeVersion |version of DevKit |
|archetypeRepository |+http://repository.mulesoft.org/releases+ |
|groupId |- |The group Id of the connector you are creating. A suggested value begins with the reverse of your company domain name, such as : `com.mycompany `or `com.mycompany.connectors`.
|artifactId |- |The artifact Id of the connector you are creating. Follow the mule naming pattern: `mule-module-xxx` where `xxx` is the name of your connector in camelCase
|version |- |A version identifier for your connector. Usually `1.0-SNAPSHOT` for a new connector project.
|muleConnectorName |- |The name of the connector, in camelCase. If you set artifactId to `mule-module-myConnector` then `myConnector` would be the value of this parameter.
|package |- |The Java package for your connector, usually the same as the groupId.
|===
+
Note the following:
* The *muleConnectorName* and *muleConnectorPackage* are the class and package names, respectively, which your IDE uses in generating the Java code for the project.
* There is a *known issue with Windows*: DevKit process will fail if run from a file path that includes spaces anywhere in the name, such as `C:\Documents and Settings\...` Ensure there are no spaces in the path of your connector project directory.
. The command line prompts you to confirm the configuration of the properties you specified (see below). Enter "Y", then press enter to confirm.

Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: org.hello
artifactId: hello-connector
version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
package: org.hello
muleConnectorName: Hello
Y: :
----

. DevKit generates your connector project in the `hello-connector` directory. Navigate to the folder and verify that the structure exists.

For help on the Maven's mvn command for Unix, including a description of available parameters, consult the main page by running `man mvn` or `mvn -?` at the shell command prompt; for Window, consult the http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/mvn/[online version].

[discrete]
==== Importing a Maven Project into Studio

. In Mule Studio, select *File > Importâ€¦*
. In the Import wizard, expand the *Maven* folder, then select *Existing Maven Projects*.

. In the wizard, enter or browse to the directory in which you created your Maven project. Select the folder for your new connector project, then click *OK*.
. Studio analyzes the `pom.xml` file. When complete, it displays your project as a checked item in the *Projects* field (see below). Click *Finish* to import the project into your workspace. Mule Studio imports the project and downloads all the required libraries; this may take several minutes.


[WARNING]
====
The Maven build automatically generates the Mule schema and namespace handler for your connector. However, Maven tooling for Studio *does not perform the full build every time you save the project*. Consequently, you must manually update your project every time you add or remove methods to your connector class.

. Right-click the connector project in Mule Studio's Package Explorer.
. Select *Maven* > *Update Project*.
====

[discrete]
==== Updating POM to Package Connector

So that you can install and test your connector, Maven should build an Eclipse plugin update site as a zip file at the end of the build process. A property `devkit.studio.package.skip` in the `pom.xml` controls whether this is built; if set to `false` then the build happens.

By default, the `pom.xml` provided by the Maven archetype for connectors in 3.4.0 _does not_ set this property. You must confirm that this property is set and add it if it is missing. Access your `pom.xml` file to confirm the existence of, or add, the following:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<properties>
...
 <jdk.version>1.6</jdk.version>
        <!-- Maven should build the update site zip file -->
        <devkit.studio.package.skip>false</devkit.studio.package.skip>

== About Your New Project

Regardless of the method you choose, the Maven archetype generates the same skeleton. The table below describes the four sources folders contained in the skeleton project.

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Folder |Description
|`src/main/java` |Contains the source Java files for your connector, including the skeleton Java file for your connector. As you add additional classes, the project stores them in this folder.
|`src/main/resources` |Contains non-code resources accessed by your connector. This folder is empty when you initially create the project.
|`src/test/java` |Contains the Java source for the test files for your connector, including the skeleton JUnit test case.
|`src/test/resources` |Contains non-code resources accessed by your tests. This folder contains a skeleton Mule configuration file for running tests.
|===

Maven also creates several files within these folders. The most important of these files are as follows:

* `src/main/java/org.mulesoft.hello/Helloconnector.java` stored in the hello-connector/src/main/java/org/mule/module/helloconnector package. This file contains the bulk of the code your write to build your connector. Upon creation, DevKit has already created some foundational classes and methods. Edit this file to add functionality specific to your target application.
* `pom.xml` Project Object Model (POM) is an XML representation of a Maven project, including all of the project's external dependencies and all instructions on how to build the project. Read more about the POM at http://maven.apache.org/pom.html[maven.apache.org].

[NOTE]
====
If you are not familiar with Maven or POM files, please see this http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[excellent tutorial].

If your project uses libraries or dependencies other than the basic Mule core (for example, if you use any of Mule's transports or modules, or third party libraries) you will need to include them as dependencies in the POM file. For this, you will need to add one or more `<dependency>` sections to the set that already exists in your POM. Each `<dependency>` section has the information for a Maven artifact (e.g. a library) your project depends on. For example, if your project uses Mule's HTTP transport you will want to add the following dependency:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.transports</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-transport-http</artifactId>
    <version>${mule.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

In this case, the value of `${mule.version}` is defined at the top of the POM file.

If you don't know the artifact name of a library, you can search for it in http://mvnrepository.com/. The website will give you the `<dependency>` section you will need to use.
