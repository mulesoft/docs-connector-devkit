Your service probably enforces some kind of authentication in order for applications to talk to your service on behalf of a user. Anypoint DevKit supports the following authentication schemes:

* xref:authentication-methods.adoc[Authentication Methods]
* xref:connection-management.adoc[Connection Management]
* xref:connector-connection-strategies.adoc[Connector Connection Strategies]
* xref:oauth-v1.adoc[OAuth V1]
* xref:oauth-v2.adoc[OAuth V2]
* xref:http-basic-authentication.adoc[HTTP Basic Authentication]
* xref:no-authentication.adoc[No Authentication]

*Note*: DevKit lets you create more than one authentication method for your connector using multiple @ConnectionStrategy annotations.

On the client side, many Mule applications need to manage multiple connections to the same target –for example, a developer of an application interacting with an e-commerce site on behalf of thousands of users need sto efficiently manage the many connections that might be live at any given moment.

In DevKit, connection management and authentication support are closely related. While a general purpose connection management framework is available for most protocols, OAuth authentication handles connection management differently.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have already xref:creating-an-anypoint-connector-project.adoc[created a connector project] with at least some basic functionality, and are now ready to implement authentication on your connector.

== Basic Authentication Using the Connection Management Framework

Anypoint DevKit makes it easy to add username and password connection management authentication functionality to connectors by applying the `@ConnectionManagement` annotation at the `@Connector` class level. Connection management with basic username and password authentication (most common) can be easily generalized to other non-OAuth protocols such as SAML, Kerberos, LDAP, NTLM, or to create a custom connection.

This framework provides the following benefits, with minimal effort on the part of the connector developer:

* *Transparent Multi-tenancy* – A Mule application can open many connections to a single target, using different credentials to connect on behalf of many users simultaneously.
* *Connection Pooling* –  Automated management of a pool of instances of the connector class, to manage connection resources effectively.
* *Exceptions* - The ability to automatically invalidate connections on exceptions, and to reconnect as needed.

For more information, see the xref:connection-management.adoc[Connection Management] guide.

== HTTP Basic Authentication

DevKit provides support for HTTP Authentication as described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt[RFC-2617].  You can implement HTTP Authentication as a @ConnectionStrategy in your @Connector class, and DevKit transparently manages the authentication for your requests.

For more information, see the xref:http-basic-authentication.adoc[HTTP Basic Authentication] guide.

== OAuth V1

Anypoint DevKit makes the implementation of the OAuth V1 on your connector rather straightforward. By simply implementing  OAuth V1 in your @Connector class, DevKit manages all of the requests to the target service.

For more information, see the xref:oauth-v1.adoc[OAuth V1] guide.

== OAuth V2

DevKit support for OAuth V2 includes its own form of connection management support. Implement OAuth2 in your @Connector class, and DevKit transparently manages multiple connections, including maintaining access tokens for multiple connections to the target service.

For more information, see the  xref:oauth-v2.adoc[OAuth V2]   guide.

== Connection Management with Other Authentication Schemes

Anypoint DevKit makes the connection management framework available, providing credentials management for multiple simultaneous connections, pooling connection instances to allow for efficient connection re-use, and providing automated handling for invalidating lost connections and reconnecting when needed.

xref:connection-management.adoc[Connection Management] describes how to apply connection management to your connector using annotations to @Connector class methods. The example describes using the annotations with basic username/password authentication, but the same methods apply for other methods as well.

You can also apply connection management to connectors that use no authentication at all. For details on implementing connection management in a connector with no authentication, see the xref:creating-a-connector-for-a-soap-service-via-cxf-client.adoc[Connector to SOAP Service via CXF Client Example].
