This document explains how to prepare a development environment that includes all the components required to develop Anypoint Connectors. You must have the following components installed and working in your local environment:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/archive-139210.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)] *version 7* only to compile and build your Java code
* <<Apache Maven>> to manage your project's build
* http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Anypoint Studio] as the IDE to build and test your connector
* Anypoint DevKit Plugin

The sections below describe the specific details necessary for setting up your connector development environment.

== Anypoint Studio

Although you can use any Java IDE with Maven support, it's strongly recommended that you use *Anypoint Studio*, as it streamlines and simplifies several of the steps needed to build your connector.

[NOTE]
To build connector projects, you must first install the Anypoint Connector DevKit add-on into Anypoint Studio.

If you have not already installed Anypoint Studio, follow the xref:3.6@mule-runtime::installing.adoc[detailed instructions] to install. For a quick introduction to Anypoint Studio, review xref:6.5@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio Essentials].

== JDK 7

Oracle makes JDK freely available for all supported platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Download version 7 of the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)] for your platform and install.

Anypoint Studio must be configured to reference the location of your JDK rather than your JRE. To set JDK as Anypoint Studio's installed JRE:

. Open Anypoint Studio.
. Open Preferences.
** *Windows* and *Linux*: Window > Preferences.
** *Mac*: Anypoint Studio > Preferences.
. Expand *Java*.
. Select *Installed JREs*.
. If Anypoint Studio is referencing the JRE rather than the JDK, edit the record and remap it to the root of your JDK installation.

== Apache Maven

Apache Maven provides a build manager that Anypoint Studio uses to build connector projects.

See http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html[Maven in Five Minutes] for a brief introduction to the concepts and basic commands.

. Download the Maven distribution from the http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven download page].
+
*Important*: For Windows use, only download Maven 3.1.1, which is available by scrolling down the Apache Maven http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[download page].
. Unpack the download to a folder on your local drive.
. Create an environment variable called `M2_HOME`, then set it to the folder into which you unpacked Maven.
. Update the `PATH` environment variable to include the path to Maven binaries.
** *Windows*: add the following to the PATH variable: `%M2_HOME%\bin`
** *Mac* or *Linux*: add the following to the PATH variable: `$M2_HOME/bin`

For more detailed instructions and installation options, see the Maven download page; instructions for different platforms are available below the download links.

== Installing the DevKit Plugin in Studio

To install the DevKit Plugin:

. To use DevKit in Studio, you must have Apache http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] installed on your local drive:
.. To confirm you have Maven installed open the Anypoint Studio preferences (on a Mac click *Anypoint* > *Preferences*, on a Windows computer, click *Window* > *Preferences*).
.. Navigate to *Anypoint Studio* > *Maven Settings* and ensure that *Maven installation home directory* points to the directory in which you installed Maven.
.. Click *Test Maven Configuration* to ensure that Maven is correctly configured.
. From the `Help` menu in *Anypoint Studio*, click *Install New Software*:

+
. In the Install menu's *Work with* drop-down menu, click the down arrow and click *Anypoint Addons Update Site*. Click the checkbox for *Anypoint DevKit Plugin*, and click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
If the Anypoint Addons Update Site is not available in the dropdown list, click *Add* and copy this URL to the repository.
