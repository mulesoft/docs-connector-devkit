= Setting Up a DevKit Development Environment
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This document explains how to prepare a development environment that includes all the components required to develop Anypoint Connectors. You must have the following components installed and working in your local environment:

* Java IDE in which to write the code for your connector
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kit 7 (JDK 7)] to compile and build your Java code
* http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] to manage your project's build
* http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Mule Studio] as the IDE in which to test your connector

The sections below describe the specific details necessary for setting up your connector development environment.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with a Java IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ) and have some familiarity with the Maven build manager for Java. Further, it assumes that you know how to install an instance of JDK 7 on your platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux).


== Java IDE Requirements

To build Anypoint Connectors for Mule, you need a Java IDE with http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] support. Although you can use any Java IDE with Maven support, the following are commonly in use by developers:

* http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/java.php[Eclipse] with http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] support for Maven installed
* Eclipse installed as part of Mule Studio, with http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse] installed
* http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html[IntelliJ IDEA], which has built-in Maven integration

[NOTE]
While *IntelliJ IDEA* and *m2eclipse* provide integration between the IDE and Maven, each depends on the presence of a standalone Maven instance in your environment.

Alternatively, you can install one of the following to use in place of an IDE:

* A standalone Eclipse installation is an easily configured foundation for a development environment for Anypoint Connectors. Install http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/juno/sr2[Eclipse 3.8 (Juno)], then add the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2e Maven] tooling for Eclipse to plug Eclipse into your connector team's daily development cycle.
* http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html[IntelliJ IDEA] is another common, popular IDE for Java, for which a free http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html[community edition] is also available. The biggest advantage of IntelliJ IDEA for connector development is that Maven support is built into IntelliJ IDEA, which eliminates a source of configuration effort in setting up your environment.

== JDK 7

Oracle makes JDK 7 freely available for all supported platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Download the latest http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kit 7 (JDK)] for your platform and install.

== Maven Build Manager

When building a connector, you use the Maven build manager to generate a new connector project, and for ongoing build activities during the connector development process. If you are not familiar with Maven, http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html[Maven in Five Minutes] provides a brief introduction to the concepts and basic commands.

. Download the Maven distribution from the http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven download page].
. Unpack the download to a folder on your local drive.
. Create an environment variable called `M2_HOME`, then set it to the folder into which you unpacked Maven.
. Update the `PATH` environment variable to include the path to Maven binaries.  +
* *Windows*: add the following line to the PATH variable: `%M2_HOME%\bin `
* *Mac* or *Linux*: add the following line to the PATH variable: `$M2_HOME/bin`

For more detailed instructions and installation options, see the Maven download page; instructions for different platforms are available below the download links.

=== Maven Tooling for Eclipse

The** **`m2e`** **plugin for Eclipse enables Eclipse to import Maven projects and update the meta-information for them. `m2e` also includes the dependency management capabilities of Maven, so any necessary libraries are downloaded and configured correctly in Eclipse when you import or update a project.

Follow the procedure below to install** m2e **as a plugin in Eclipse 4.3 or later.

. In Eclipse, under the *Help* menu, select *Install New Software*.
. In the *Work with* field of the *Install* panel, use the drop-down to select the following URL:
+
`m2eclipse Update Site - http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases`
+
[TIP]
====
If the m2eclipse update site does not appear as an option in the drop-down menu, you can click *Add*, then manually enter the URL.

Further, if using an earlier version of Eclipse, you may need to download a corresponding previous version of m2e. In Eclipse, go the the Eclipse Marketplace (*Help* > **Eclipse Marketplace...**) to find the version of m2e you need to install.
====
+
. In the table, select *Maven Integration for Eclipse*, then click *Next*.
. In the *Install Details* window, click *Next* to continue installation.
. In the *Review Licenses* window, accept the terms of the license agreement, then click *Finish*.
. After Eclipse completes installation of the `m2e` plugin, click *Restart Now* to complete the installation and restart Eclipse.

== Mule Studio

As a DevKit developer, you need http://www.mulesoft.org/download-mule-esb-community-edition[Mule Studio] to test your connector. If you have not already installed Mule Studio, follow the xref:3.4@mule-runtime::downloading-and-launching-mule-esb.adoc[detailed instructions] to install. For a quick introduction to Mule Studio, review https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/5/index[Mule Studio Essentials].

You can also use Mule Studio, with m2eclipse installed, as your DevKit IDE (running a second instance, alongside your test environment) to build your connectors.
