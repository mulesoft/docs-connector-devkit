The `@OutboundHeaders` annotation is used on `@Processor` methods to mark a parameter that will be populated with outbound headers that will be set with the outgoing message. For example, when sending an email message, you may want to set properties such as "from" or "subject" as a sender header. This annotation must only be defined on a parameter of type `java.util.Map`.

== Restrictions

A method annotated with `@Processor` can have *at most* one parameter annotated with `@Payload`, `@InboundHeaders`, `@InvocationHeaders` or `@OutboundHeaders`.

For example this is not possible:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Processor
    public Object myMethod(@Payload Object payload, @OutboundHeaders Map<String, Object> headers) {
----
