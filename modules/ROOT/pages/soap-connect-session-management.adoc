To support SOAP-based connector development, *DevKit 3.9.0* comes equipped with the option for the connector developer to define a *session token* for managing SOAP service connections, SOAP sessions or any service operations requiring a token.

== Introduction

Create a session token from your connector code within the `@Connect` method, and utilize it according to any operations the SOAP service requires.

This is a means to managing user access to the service through the connector. For more information on session token placement inside the body see <<enriching-the-soap-body-with-session-token,Enriching the SOAP Body With Session Token>>.

Session management allows you to:

* Inject the session token into:
** HTTP cookies, and headers
** SOAP Headers
** SOAP Payload: chain of responsibility for managing the message payload. This might need to be managed by the WSDL Consumer.
* Manage session expiration/timeout
* Acquire connection management intelligence (about configurations and reconnection)
//todo: i did not create the term 'connection intelligence', but I figure it means that the developer could use the session token to allow a reconnection using the same token. Or is it better practice to use a different session token to identify a 'reconnection', or none of our business to determine that?

== Requirements

To enable session management for your connector, the `Config` class must be annotated with `@WsdlProvider` and `@ConnectionManagement`, which require implementation of the following methods, respectively:

For WSDL Management:

* @WsdlServiceRetriever
* @WsdlServiceEndpoint

For Connection Management:

* @Connect
* @Disconnect
* @ValidateConnection

See the stub for the session management-enabled Config class in the <<wsdlprovider-with-session-management,@WsdlProvider with Session Management>> section below.

== Connector Lifecycle with Session Management

The lifecycle of the connector will be modified by "session control", during both fetching of metadata and operation invocation. Before fetching metadata and invoking operations, a connector instance is retrieved from or created in the pool, and then the `@Connect` method would be invoked to initialize the connection.

Connection pooling works like the current xref:connection-management.adoc#about-connection-management[Connection Management] mechanism; by using the same kind of pool configuration for the connector instances available via a connector configuration tab. Configuration of existing connector instances or creation of new ones is handled by the user from there.

Since the `@Connect` method is invoked before any of the common `@WsdlProvider` methods, all the required parameters for connection must be provided via a `@Configurable` field or `@Connect` parameter. Initialization may take place inside the `@Connect` method in order to save results like session tokens.

== @WsdlProvider with Session Management

See the structure of the `@WsdlProvider` Config class below, noting that the session token should be created in the `@Connect` method and stored in an instance field for use in whichever part of the SOAP message is required, depending on the case:
//todo: describe instance field

@WsdlProvider(friendlyName = "Configuration")
@ConnectionManagement
public class Config {

    private String username;
    private String password;

    @Configurable
    @Default("http://localhost:8088/mockTshirt")
    @Placement(order = 3)
    private String endpoint;

    @Connect
    @TestConnectivity
    public void connect(@ConnectionKey String username,  @Password String password)  throws ConnectionException {
        // obtain session token
    }

    @Disconnect
    public void disconnect() {
        // end connection
    }

    @ValidateConnection
    public boolean isConnected() {
        return false;
    }

    @WsdlServiceRetriever
    public ServiceDefinition getServiceDefinition() {
           return new DefaultServiceDefinition("ServiceID", "tshirt", "tshirt.wsdl","TshirtService","TshirtServicePort");
    }

    @WsdlServiceEndpoint
    public String getServiceEndpoint(ServiceDefinition definition) {
         return endpoint;
    }

    @WsdlHeaders
    public List<Document> cookHeaders(ServiceDefinition serviceDefinition, String operationName){
        // Customize headers with session token
    }

    @WsdlTransportRetriever
    public WsdlTransport resolveTransport(ServiceDefinition serviceDefinition) {
        return new HttpBasicWsdlTransport(getUsername(), getPassword());
    }

    // ...
}

== Enriching the SOAP Body With Session Token

With the release of DevKit 3.9.0 the `@WsdlBodyEnricher` can be used to inject the session token into the SOAP body.

=== @WsdlBodyEnricher

The method marked `@WsdlBodyEnricher` should receive an object representing the message payload, and return it modified with the session token.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@WsdlBodyEnricher
    public Document cookPayload(ServiceDefinition serviceDefinition, String operationName, Document payload){
        // Customize payload with session token
    }
