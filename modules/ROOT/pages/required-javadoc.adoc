In order to generate the documentation properly we defined a minimum set of JavaDoc comments and tags. Remember to provide as much details as possible in the documentation to help users better understand how to use your Mule extension.

== Documenting `@Module` and `@Connector` Annotated Classes

Each class annotated with `@Module` or `@Connector` must have a class level JavaDoc comment with a high level overview of the extensions. It is also required to include the `@author` tag.

Example from Zuora Cloud Connector:

[source,text,linenums]
----
/** * Zuora is the leader in online recurring billing and payment solutions for SaaS and subscription businesses. * <p/> * This connector provides full access to the Z-Commerce platform API. * * @author MuleSoft, Inc. */@Connector(name = "zuora")public class ZuoraModule {
----

== Documenting `@Configurable` Annotated Fields

Each field annotated with `@Configurable` is required to have a JavaDoc comment briefly explaining what this attribute is used for.

Example from the https://github.com/mulesoft/magento-connector[Magento Cloud Connector]:

[source,text,linenums]
----
    /**     * The user name to access Magento Web Services     */    @Configurable    private String username;    /**     * The password to access Magento Web Services     */    @Configurable    private String password;    /**     * The address to access Magento Web Services     */    @Configurable    private String address;
----

== Documenting `@Processor` and `@Source` Methods

Each method annotated with `@Processor` and `@Source` must have a JavaDoc comment. It is also required each parameter of these methods to have a description. In addition, if the method has a return type different than `void` then it should have the `@return` JavaDoc tag with a description.

The DevKit has introduced a custom tag `@sample.xml` to provide examples on how to use each method from Mule. The example pointed by this tag will receive special treatment when the documentation is generated using the DevKit's custom doclet.

Example from the Mongo Cloud Connector:

[source,text,linenums]
----
    /**     * Creates a new collection. If the collection already exists, a MongoException     * will be thrown.     * <p/>     * {@sample.xml ../../../doc/mongo-connector.xml.sample mongo:create-collection}     *     * @param collection the name of the collection to create     * @param capped if the collection will be capped     * @param maxObjects the maximum number of documents the new collection is able     *            to contain     * @param size the maximum size of the new collection     */    @Processor    public void createCollection(String collection,                                 @Optional @Default(CAPPED_DEFAULT_VALUE) boolean capped,                                 @Optional Integer maxObjects,                                 @Optional Integer size)    {        client.createCollection(collection, capped, maxObjects, size);    }
----

Note how the `@sample.xml` is used: inside curly braces put his tag, a relative path from src/main/java to the file where the examples are, and a logic name for the example. For the logic name of the example we recommend to use the notation `myconnector:my-method-name` or `myconnector:myMethodName`.

The examples file pointed by the `@sample.xml` tag must have the following structure:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-a) -->// example here<!-- END_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-a) --><!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-b) -->// example here<!-- END_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-b) -->......
----

For example the SalesForce Cloud Connector examples file looks like:

*examples file*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(sfdc:create) --><sfdc:create type="Account">    <sfdc:objects>        <sfdc:object>            <Name>MuleSoft</Name>            <BillingStreet>30 Maiden Lane</BillingStreet>            <BillingCity>San Francisco</BillingCity>            <BillingState>CA</BillingState>            <BillingPostalCode>94108</BillingPostalCode>            <BillingCountry>US</BillingCountry>        </sfdc:object>    </sfdc:objects></sfdc:create><!-- END_INCLUDE(sfdc:create) --><!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(sfdc:upsert) --><sfdc:upsert type="Account" externalIdFieldName="InternalAccountCode">    <sfdc:objects>        <sfdc:object>            <InternalAccountCode>A01596</InternalAccountCode>            <Name>MuleSoft</Name>            <BillingStreet>30 Maiden Lane</BillingStreet>            <BillingCity>San Francisco</BillingCity>            <BillingState>CA</BillingState>            <BillingPostalCode>94108</BillingPostalCode>            <BillingCountry>US</BillingCountry>        </sfdc:object>    </sfdc:objects></sfdc:upsert><!-- END_INCLUDE(sfdc:upsert) -->......
