= Configuring Extensions
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

Normally a Mule extension will have global configuration parameters and operation specific parameters. The former, is related to instance variables or global state meaning that is state persistent across operations.

Instance variables that need to be exposed to Mule need to have a special metedata to signal the Annotation Processor that the field can be assigned inside a Mule configuration XML file. The DevKit provides the `@Configurable` annotation for this case. In other words, any instance variable of a Connector or Module that needs to be configured by the users has to marked with `@Configurable`

An extension can have any number of `@Configurable` fields and these fields can be of primitive or complex types. Additionally, a `@Configurable` field can be optionally set from Mule and can take a default value in case a value is not assigned to it.

_Note_: all of the examples and explanations in this page apply for `@Connector` annotated classes as well as `@Module` annotated ones.

== The `@Configurable` Annotation

The `@Configurable` annotation is used to signal the generator for all the bean properties that will be configurable for each instance of your connector. In addition to the `@Configurable` annotation, a public setter is needed.

Usage example:

[source,java,linenums]
----
import org.mule.api.annotations.Configurable;
import org.mule.api.annotations.Connector;

@Connector(name = "myconnector")
public class MyConnector {

    @Configurable
    private String key;

    public void setKey(String key) {
       this.key = key;
    }
----

Then the module or connector can be configured as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<myconnector:config key="myKey" />
----

Notice that by annotating a field only with `@Configurable` it is mandatory to assign a value it when configuring the extension in the xml.

== @Optional

The `@Optional` annotation is used together with the `@Configurable` field and it indicates that the field is configurable but it is not mandatory to do so.

Usage example:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Module(name = "mymodule")
public class MyModule {

    @Configurable
    @Optional
    private String key;

    public void setKey(String key) {
       this.key = key;
    }
----

Then the connector can be configured as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<myconnector:config key="myKey" />
----

And the following is valid as well since it is optional to assign a value to it:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<myconnector:config />
----

== @Default

The `@Default` annotation is used together with `@Configurable` and `@Optional` and is used to provide a default value to a configurable field in case one is not assigned explicitly.

Usage example:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Module(name = "mymodule")
public class MyModule {

    @Configurable
    @Optional
    @Default("testKey")
    private String key;

    public void setKey(String key) {
       this.key = key;
    }
----

Then the connector can be configured as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<myconnector:config key="myKey" />
----

Or if the `key` attribute is not present it will implicitly be assigned the value `testKey` as defined by the `@Default` annotation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<myconnector:config />
----

== Multiple Configurations

It is possible to have more than one configuration. Such case may be the Mongo Connector having one configuration to access a database in one server (username, host, port, etc.) and another one for a different server. When multiple configurations are present it is necessary to provide a name to them so that they can be referenced later.

One configuration, notice that the invoking a message processor it is not required to specify a name for the configuration because there is only one:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mongo:config host="{db.host}" port="{db.port}" username="${db.username}"
                  password="${db.password}" database="${db.name}"/>

    <flow name="ListCollections">
        <http:inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:8080/list-collections"/>
        <mongo:list-collections />
    </flow>
----

Two configurations, when multiple configurations are defined a name for each of them must be provided so they can be referenced later. Notice the `name` attribute fot the `mongo:config` element and the `config-ref` attribute in `mongo:list-collections`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mongo:config host="${db.host1}" port="${db.port1}" username="${db.username1}"
                  password="${db.password1}" database="${db.name1}" name="config1"  />

    <mongo:config host="${db.host2}" port="${db.port2}" username="${db.username2}"
                  password="${db.password2}" database="${db.name2}" name="config2"  />

    <flow name="ListCollections1">
        <http:inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:8080/list-collections1"/>
        <mongo:list-collections config-ref="config1" />
    </flow>

    <flow name="ListCollections2">
        <http:inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:8080/list-collections2"/>
        <mongo:list-collections config-ref="config2" />
    </flow>
----

_Note_: there is no restriction as to the number of configurations a extension can have.

== Restrictions

Some restrictions apply to `@Configurable` annotated fields:

* can only be used in classes annotated with `@Connector` or `@Module`
* cannot be applied to static fields
* cannot be applied to final fields
* cannot be applied to array fields

== Configuration-less

There are cases in which modules do not actually expect any configuration or they can work out of the box with the configuration default values.

Since DevKit 3.3 the config element is now entirely optional when the following conditions are met:

* The module does not use any @Configurable or if it does they are all options with proper defaults.
* In the case of connectors, they cannot use OAuth 1.0a nor OAuth 2.0 annotations since those annotations introduce mandatory configuration.
