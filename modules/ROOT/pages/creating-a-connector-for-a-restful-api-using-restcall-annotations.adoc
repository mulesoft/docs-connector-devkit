include::partial$devkit-important.adoc[]

This example walks you through the implementation of an Anypoint Connector for a RESTful API. Anypoint DevKit provides a convenient set of annotations called `@RESTCall` for creating a Connector for a RESTful API.

The `@RestCall` annotations are applied to methods (`@Processor`) in a Connector's `@Connector` class that declaratively describe the URLs for resources exposed on the API. At compile time, Anypoint DevKit generates client code for all the operations, and provides most of the functionality for the methods. For particularly well-defined RESTful APIs, this can be a convenient solution for quickly producing a connector.

This discussion sketches the architecture of a `@RestCall`-based connector, introduces the `@RestCall` annotations and their use, and finally presents a sample Facebook connector that implements some basic operations.

== Assumptions

This document assumes you are familiar with RESTful APIs, and with the DevKit connector architecture described in xref:index.adoc[Anypoint Connector DevKit].

== @RestCall-Based Connector Architecture

DevKit has built-in client functionality that can handle many "well-behaved" RESTful Web services, which require clean URLs, correct HTTP verb usage, etc.

The client is exposed through a set of annotations (the `@RestCall` annotations) that you apply to your `@Connector` class and its methods.

Compared to most connectors, creating these connectors requires writing very little code. You still define a `@Connector` class, with properties and methods; but in this case, the `@Connector` class and its methods are all abstract. (Any entity classes passed to the operations are still concrete classes, as with other connector types.) For each operation, apply the `@RestCall` annotations to provide:

* A URI template for the target resource
* The HTTP verb for the request
* Any parameters to substitute into the URI or send in the query/POST body to parameterize the request

DevKit generates the entire REST client in a subclass that implements the abstract method. You as a developer never see this class.

This level of simplicity is possible because the patterns for accessing a well-defined RESTful API are extremely consistent.

== About the @RestCall Client and Annotations

DevKit provides a set of annotations to simplify working with RESTful APIs. These annotations handle all necessary operations, generating each REST call, and incorporating each REST call parameter.

The generated code creates the URI, which is based on the arguments passed to the `@RestCall` annotation, and makes a request using the verb specified by the `method` parameter of `@RestCall`.

The URI is populated with every item annotated with the `@RestUriParam` annotation. In the example below, the `bucket` portion of the URI, indicated between braces, is replaced with the contents of `bucketName`, as specified in the `@RestUriParam` annotation on the last line. (The example below is based on the Amazon S3 connector.)

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Processor
@RestCall(uri = "http://{bucket}.s3.amazonaws.com/?max-keys=0", method = HttpMethod.HEAD)
    public abstract Object bucketExists(@RestUriParam("bucket"),
         String bucketName);
----

As explained below, you can use the `@RestUriParam` annotation, as well as other related annotations, on `@Processor` method arguments or `@Configurable` fields of the connector.

When generating the request call, DevKit includes a non-annotated argument and an argument annotated with `@Payload` as the body of the call.

== @RestCall Annotations Reference

The sections below detail the full set of annotations for implementing a connector against a RESTful API.

=== @RestCall

Used with the `@Processor` annotation. Indicates that upon invocation, the processor makes a RESTful request.

==== Required Arguments

* `uri`: URI of the REST resource to query
* `method`: HTTP method to use

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Processor
@RestCall(uri = "http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/?max-keys=0",
   method = HttpMethod.HEAD)
   public abstract Object bucketExists("mybucket")
   String bucketName);
----

The example above uses a static URI. For details on using dynamically-generated URIs, see `@RestURIParam`.

=== @RestQueryParam

Specifies URI query parameters, which are appended to the path of the URI after a `?` or `&` symbol. You can apply this annotation to `@Processor` method arguments or to connector fields marked `@Configurable`. This enables you to use dynamically-generated arguments as query parameters.

==== Required Arguments

* String representation of the name of the parameter to append

[source,java,linenums]
----
@RestCall(uri = ("http://myservice.com/standard?id=1234",
   method = org.mule.api.annotations.rest.HttpMethod.GET)
   ...
   Public abstract String getID(@RestQueryParam("id")
   String numID)
----

=== @RestURIParam

Allows you to insert URI parameters that are part of the URI path itself, which is required by some URIs. As with the `@RestQueryParam` annotation, you can apply this annotation to `@Processor` methods arguments or to connector fields marked `@Configurable`. This enables you to use dynamically-generated arguments as URI parameters.

==== Required Arguments

* Argument to the message processor to replace using a URI parameter

To use the `@RestURIParam` annotation, you must specify the argument in the URI to replace with the annotation, by surrounding it with curly braces. In the example below, the argument is `{path`}.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@RestCall(uri = "http://myservice.com/{path}", method = HttpMethod.HEAD)
----

Reference the argument in the `@RestURIParam` annotation:

[source,text,linenums]
----
...
Public abstract String setPath(@RestURIParam String path ...
----

=== @RestHeaderParam

Allows you to insert custom headers in the call. You can apply this annotation to `@Processor` method arguments or to a `@Configurable` field of the HTTP header marked in the annotation. This enables you to use dynamically-generated arguments as query parameters.

==== Required Arguments

* Name of the header to include in the call.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@RestHeaderParam("AuthorizationCode")
@Configurable private String authorizationCode;
@Processor
@RestCall(uri = "http://\{bucket\}.s3.amazonaws.com/?max-keys=0",
   method = HttpMethod.HEAD)
   public abstract Object bucketExists(@UriParam("bucket")
   String bucketName);
----

=== @RestPostParam

Allows you to set parameters in the body of POST method calls. You can apply this annotation to `@Processor` method arguments or to connector fields marked `@Configurable`. DevKit ensures that you apply this annotation only to POST methods.

Processor methods annotated with `@RestPostParam` cannot use a non-annotated argument or a `@Payload` annotated argument.

== Implementing a @RestCall Connector

The remainder of this document walks you through implementing a `@RestCall` connector. You can follow the walkthrough literally to build this specific example, or you can apply the same process to build a connector for your own API.

=== Example @RestCall Connector: Facebook Graph API

The Facebook Graph API is the primary way for apps to get data into and out of Facebook's social graph and interact with the Facebook platform. For background information, see Facebook's https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/graphapi/[Getting Started: The Graph API].

This discussion is built around a sample connector for the Facebook Graph API that uses OAuth authentication and exposes two operations:

* Retrieve the profile information of a specified user as a User object
* Post an update on the Facebook Timeline for a specified user +

=== Setting Up Access to the Facebook Graph API

The Graph API supports unauthenticated access for reading public information, but requires OAuth2 authentication for write access. OAuth2 access to the Graph API requires that you:

* Sign up for a Facebook developer account
* Create a Facebook application (which associates your Facebook client application with your developer account identity on Facebook's servers)

For details on setting up authenticated API access, see the http://developers.facebook.com/docs/samples/meals-with-friends/register-facebook-application/[Facebook documentation]. Facebook generates a *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret*, which you need to complete the exercise.

== Implementing the @Connector Class

The RestCall client can be used with the `@OAuth` authentication annotations or the connection management framework. In this case, the Facebook connector uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. The abstract `@Connector` class, `FacebookConnector`, gets the `@RestCall` annotations and OAuth-related annotations on the class.

The following code excerpt is taken from the `@Connector` class `FacebookConnector`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
/**
 * Facebook OAuth2 connector
 *
 */
@OAuth2(accessTokenUrl = "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token",
        authorizationUrl = "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize",
        accessTokenRegex = "access_token=([^&]+?)&", expirationRegex = "expires=([^&]+?)$")
@Connector(name = "facebook-connector")
public abstract class FacebookConnector {

    /**
     * Your application's client identifier (consumer key in Remote Access Detail).
     */
    @Configurable
    @OAuthConsumerKey
    private String consumerKey;


    /**
     * Your application's client secret (consumer secret in Remote Access Detail).
     */
    @Configurable
    @OAuthConsumerSecret
    private String consumerSecret;

    //@RestQueryParam("access_token")
    @OAuthAccessToken
    private String accessToken;


    @OAuthCallbackParameter(expression = "#[json:id]")
    private String userId;

    @OAuthAccessTokenIdentifier
    public String getUserId() {
        return userId;
    }


    /* ...Getters and setters omitted */
}
----

Notes:

* The class `FacebookConnector` is an abstract class, which is required for a `RestCall` connector
* The OAuth2 annotations are used on the relevant methods and properties, as described in xref:oauth-v2.adoc[OAuth V2] +
* Code for operations are omitted at this stage

== Implementing Data Model Entity Classes

Define any entity classes that represent the data passed to and returned from the Web service requests, and how JSON documents map to Java classes used with the connector.

Given a JSON schema or sample documents for the service, you can generate classes using the tool *JSONSchema2POJO*, available at http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/. (The https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/wiki[wiki on GitHub] provides getting started and reference documentation for JSONSchema2POJO.)

After you create your data model classes, add them to your project, and import them into your `@Connector` class.

=== Example: Facebook User Class

For our example, class `User` is the entity class that passes data about a Facebook user to the API. Define and add this class to the project before you implement the operations that use it.

The full definition for `User.java` follows:

Notes:

* The @Generated("com.googlecode.jsonschema2pojo") annotation indicates that this class was generated using the https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/wiki/Getting-Started#the-maven-plugin[JSONSchema2POJO] tool, hosted at http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/.
* The multiple imports from package `org.codehaus.jackson.annotate` and the specific annotations used (such as `@JsonProperty, @JsonAnySetter, @JsonAnyGetter`) reflect the fact that the RestCall client uses Jackson internally to serialize and deserialize JSON data exchanged with the service. Be sure to use JSONSchema2POJO in Jackson mode.

== Adding Operations to the @Connector Class

When implementing operations on the `@Connector` class, note that for `RESTCall` connectors the operation methods, like the class itself, are abstract. Annotations on the methods specify:

* A template for the REST URL, with placeholders for parameters
* Values to:  +
** Substitute for the placeholders in the URL
** Append as GET query parameters
** Send in the POST body
* The class to expect as the return value
* The HTTP request method to use (such as GET, POST, or PUT)

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Apply a Test-Driven Approach* +

Based on MuleSoft experience, most successful connector implementation projects follow a cycle similar to test-driven development when building out operations on a connector:

* Determine detailed requirements for the operation – entities (POJOs or Maps with specific content) that a connector can accept as input or return as responses; any edge cases like invalid values, values of the wrong type, and so on; and what exceptions the operation may raise.
* Implement jUnit tests that cover those requirements.
* Implement enough of your operations to pass those tests, including creating new entity classes and exceptions.
* Update your `@Connector` class and other code with the comments that populate the Javadoc related to each operation.

Iterate until you cover all the scenarios covered in your requirements for an operation. Then use the same cycle to implement each operation, until your connector functionality is complete.

If your client library is well-documented, the expected behaviors for operations should be clear, and you may be able to get away with less unit testing for edge cases and certain exceptional situations, but bear in mind that your connector is only as reliable as the Java client you base it on.

You may ask, "When do I try my connector in Studio?" It is useful, as well as gratifying, to manually test each operation as you go, in addition to the automated JUnit tests. Testing each operation allows you to:

* See basic operation functionality in action as you work on it, which gives you a sense of progress.
* See how the connector appears in the Studio UI, something the automated unit tests cannot show you. For example, text from the Javadoc comments is used to populate tooltips for the fields in the dialog boxes in the connector.

Manual testing provides the opportunity to polish the appearance of the connector, improve the experience with sensible defaults, and so on.

However, this does not diminish the value of the test-driven approach. Many connector development projects have bogged down or produced hard-to-use connectors because of a failure to define tests as you define the operations, which it seems like (and is) more work up front, but does pay off – you get a better result, faster.

For details on developing connector tests, see xref:developing-devkit-connector-tests.adoc[Developing DevKit Connector Tests].

=== Example: FacebookConnector Operation Methods

The following connector exposes the `getUser()` and `publishWall()` operations:

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
     * GET a user profile.
     * {@sample.xml ../../../examples/Facebook.default.xml.sample facebook-connector:default}
     *
     * @param user
     * Represents the ID of the user object.
     * @param metadata
     * The Graph API supports introspection of objects, which lets
     * you see all of the connections an object has without knowing
     * its type ahead of time.
     * @return  a User object.
     * @throws IOException
     * when the call fails
     */
    @Processor
    @RestCall(uri = "https://graph.facebook.com/{user}", method = HttpMethod.GET)
    public abstract User getUser(
        @RestUriParam("user") String user,
        @RestQueryParam("metadata") String metadata)
        throws IOException
    ;

    /**
     * Post a message on a user's wall
     * {@sample.xml ../../../examples/Facebook.default.xml.sample facebook-connector:default}
     *
     * @param message
     * Message to be published
     * @param user
     * User ID
     * @return  No return information available
     * @throws IOException
     * when the call fails
     */
    @OAuthProtected
    @Processor
    @RestCall(uri = "https://graph.facebook.com/{user}/feed", method = HttpMethod.POST, contentType = "application/json")
    public abstract String publishWall(
        @RestUriParam("user") String user,
        @RestPostParam("message") String message)
        throws IOException
    ;
----

Notes:

* `getUser()` does not have the `@OAuthProtected` annotation. Facebook permits getting some user information even without authentication (though a more complete response may be returned with authentication, depending on the authenticated user's relationship to the requested user, the privacy settings of the requested user, and so on)
* Posting to a wall requires authentication, so it is annotated `@OAuthProtected`

After you have a connector that works well enough to install in Studio and to pass basic unit tests, you can:

* Continue to add operations through the iterative process described above, until you have your desired operations and test cases that validate all desired behaviors.
* Refine the appearance of the connector dialog boxes and XML element through more annotations, as described in xref:defining-connector-attributes.adoc[Defining Connector Attributes].
