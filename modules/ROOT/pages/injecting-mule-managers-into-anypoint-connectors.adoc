DevKit can inject several Mule managers into your module via the standard injection annotation `@Inject`.

For example, to access Mule's expression manager:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Inject
private ExpressionManager expressionManager;
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember:

* Every field requiring injection must have a public setter method.
* The injection mechanism currently only works on fields.
* Method parameters annotated with `@Inject` will be ignored.
