= Injecting Mule Managers

[CAUTION]
====
This feature is only available since 3.0.3
====

The DevKit can inject several Mule managers into your module. This mechanism is implemented via the use of the standard injection annotation _@Inject_.

For example, if you wish to access Mule's expression manager you can do so as follows:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Inject
private ExpressionManager expressionManager;
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember that every field that needs injection must have a public setter method. Also the injection mechanism currently only works on fields. Method parameters annotated with _@Inject_ will be ignored.
