= Managing Connections
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

*Mule DevKit* can generate automatic connection management around a POJO. Special annotations trigger the DevKit to generate code that automatically manages connections. You annotate methods that handle connecting, disconnecting, and validating connections, and getting a session identifier; Mule DevKit's *Annotation Processor* manages the rest.

For example, if a 3rd-party API fails because the session expires, Mule DevKit automatically drops the connection, establishes a new one, then retries the operation (see code below).

== The `@Connect` Annotation

This annotation indicates the method inside a `@Connector` that is responsible for creating a connection. The connector's connection manager calls this `@Connect` annotation. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@Connect` or the compilation fails.

A method annotated with `@Connect` must:

* be `public`
* throw `org.mule.api.ConnectionException` exceptions (DevKit permits no other exceptions)
* have a `void` return type

== The `@Disconnect` Annotation

This annotation indicates the method inside a `@Connector` that is responsible for disposing of a connection. The connector's connection manager calls this `@Disconnect` annotation. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@Disconnect` or the compilation fails.

A method annotated with `@Disconnect` must:

* be `public`
* decline to receive parameters
* have a `void` return type

== The `@ValidateConnection` Annotation

This annotation indicates the method inside a `@Connector` that checks whether the connector is actually connected or not. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@ValidateConnection` or the compilation fails.

A method annotated with `@ValidateConnection` must:

* be `public`
* decline to receive parameters
* return `boolean` or `java.lang.Boolean`

== The `@ConnectionIdentifier` Annotation

This annotation indicates the method inside a `@Connector` that is responsible for identifying a connection. The connector's connection manager calls this `@Disconnect` annotation for debugging purposes. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@ConnectionIdentifier` or the compilation fails.

A method annotated with `@ConnectionIdentifier` must:

* be `public`
* not be `static`
* not take arguments
* return `java.lang.String`

== The `@InvalidateConnectionOn` Annotation

Attach this annotation to any method which contains an `@Processor` or `@Source` annotation. `@InvalidataeConnectionOn` receives a single argument which is the class of the exception to be caught. If the Processor/Source throws an exception, `@InvalidateConnectionOn` automatically invalidates the connection.
