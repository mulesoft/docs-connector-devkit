= Managing Connections
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

The DevKit can generate automatic connection management around a POJO. By adding special annotations the DevKit will generate code that will automatically manage connections. It is necessary to mark methods that will handle connecting, disconnecting, validating connections, getting a session identifier and the DevKit's Annotation Processing Tool will take care of the rest. This is what truly differentiates a `@Connector` annotated extension from a `@Module` one.

As an example if a third party API fails because the session expired, the DevKit will automatically drop the connection, establish a new one and retry the operation.

Example:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Connector(name = "saas")
public class SaaSConnector
{
    @Connect
    public void connect(@ConnectionKey String username, String password) { ... }

    @Disconnect
    public void disconnect() { ... }

    @ValidateConnection
    public boolean isConnected() { ... }

    @ConnectionIdentifier
    public boolean getSessionId() { ... }
}
----

== The `@Connect` Annotation

This annotation marks a method inside a `@Connector` as the responsible for creating a connection. It will be called by the connector's connection manager. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@Connect` otherwise compilation will fail.

A method annotated with `@Connect` has to follow certain rules:

* it must be `public`
* it has to declare it throws `org.mule.api.ConnectionException`, no other exceptions are allowed
* it cannot have a return type different than `void`

== The `@Disconnect` Annotation

This annotation marks a method inside a `@Connector` as the responsible for disposing a connection. It will be called by the connector's connection manager. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@Disconnect` otherwise compilation will fail.

A method annotated with `@Disconnect` has to follow certain rules:

* it must be `public`
* it cannot receive any parameters
* it cannot have a return type different than `void`

== The `@ValidateConnection` Annotation

This annotation marks a method inside a `@Connector` as the responsible for validating if the connector is actually connected or not. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@ValidateConnection` otherwise compilation will fail.

A method annotated with `@ValidateConnection` has to follow certain rules:

* it must be `public`
* it cannot receive parameters
* it cannot have a return type different than `boolean` or `java.lang.Boolean`

== The `@ConnectionIdentifier` Annotation

This annotation marks a method inside a `@Connector` as the responsible for identifying a connection. It will be called by the connector's connection manager for debugging purposes. There must be exactly one method annotated with `@ConnectionIdentifier` otherwise compilation will fail.

A method annotated with `@ConnectionIdentifier` has to follow certain rules:

* it must be `public`
* it must not be `static`
* it cannot receive parameters
* it must return `java.lang.String`

== The `@InvalidateConnectionOn` Annotation

This annotation can be attached to any method also annotated with `@Processor` or `@Source`. It receives a single argument which is the class of the exception to be caught. If the exception is thrown by the Processor/Source it will automatically invalidate the connection.
