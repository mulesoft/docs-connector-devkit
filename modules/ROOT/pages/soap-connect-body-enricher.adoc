With the release of DevKit 3.8.0. the `@WsdlBodyEnricher` annotation is intended for the session token to be injected into the SOAP body.
//todo: is it really being injected into the wsdl, or is it called the soap message?

== Implementation

The method marked as `@WsdlBodyEnricher` should receive an object representing the message payload, and return it modified with the session token.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@WsdlBodyEnricher
    public Document cookPayload(ServiceDefinition serviceDefinition, String operationName, Document payload){
        // Customize payload with session token
    }
----

== Background

As with the SOAP headers modifier, the invocation of this body enricher method occurs after all the connection and initialization steps are complete.
