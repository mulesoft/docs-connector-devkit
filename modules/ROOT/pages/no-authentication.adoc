When a connector does not use authentiation, you can use `@Connector` with `@Configuration`.

`@Configuration` adds a set of `@Configurable` fields to your connector as a connector configuration.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with the xref:index.adoc[Anypoint Connector DevKit] and you are ready to implement a configuration in your connector.

== @Configuration Annotation

To implement a `@Configuration` on your Connector, create a new class and annotate it with @Configuration.

The following table describes the parameters for the `@Configuration` annotation:

[%header,cols="4*a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Required? |Default Value
|*friendlyName* |Defines the name that is going to be displayed in the connector configuration pop up. |âœ“
|*configElementName* |Defines the name for the configuration  that is going to be used in the mule app. |  |config
|===

== Example

Ensure these instance variables have public getters and setters (not shown).
