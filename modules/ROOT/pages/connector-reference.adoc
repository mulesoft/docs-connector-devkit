This document provides reference information about creating connectors.

== Prerequisites

In order to develop connectors (and Mule extensions, in general) using *Mule DevKit*, the following are required:

* Java JDK 1.6+
* Maven 3.x

== The `@Connector` Annotation

The class level `@Connector` annotation indicates that a Java class needs to be processed by DevKit's *Annotation Processor* and must be considered a connector.

The `@Connector` annotation defines the following annotation type element declarations:

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|Annotation type element |Description |Required/Optional |Default value
|name |defines the name of the connector |REQUIRED |
|schemaVersion |the version of the schema that will be generated by the DevKit |OPTIONAL |1.0
|namespace |the namespace of the connector |OPTIONAL |+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/name
|schemaLocation+ |the location of the schema file that will be written to the spring.schemas file |OPTIONAL |+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/name/schemaVersion/mule-name.xsd+  +
 +
 and +
 +
 \{\{+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/+}}name/current/mule-name.xsd
|minMuleVersion |the minimum Mule version for which the connector is to be used. This will be checked in runtime during the initialise phase of the lifecycle. |OPTIONAL |3.2
|===

== Mule Version Verification

At runtime, DevKit compares the `minMuleVersion` annotation parameter value against the version of Mule where it is deployed. This check is done during the Initialisation phase. Where the version of the Mule instance is older than `minMuleVersion`, the extension fails to initialize and DevKit logs a proper error message.

The goal of this verification is to prevent possible runtime errors when the extension is executed in an older Mule version than the one for which the extension was originally developed.

== Restrictions

The following restrictions apply to types annotated with `@Connector`.

* cannot be applied to interfaces
* cannot be applied to final classes
* cannot be applied to parametrized classes
* cannot be applied to non-public classes
* must contain exactly one method annotated with `@Connect`
* must contain exactly one method annotated with `@Disconnect`
