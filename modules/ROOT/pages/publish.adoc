= Publishing Your Module

After you have create a new extension, you can submit it as a project in GitHub. This allows you to share it with the Mule community so you can get feedback on the quality and design of the module before putting it into production.

Just as you may have made use of the available extensions that were submitted by others, the extension you create can help others.

== Submitting Extensions

To help make Mule extensions available to the Mule community, create a readme page on your GitHub site with as many details as possible. This helps people search for Mule extensions and helps them decide if your extension is right for their needs.

Include a link to the source code repository and to the documentation for your extension. The documentation should be as complete as possible to help users start using your extension.
