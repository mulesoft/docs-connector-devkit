//todo: make sub-item of https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/creating-a-soap-connector#coding-with-wsdlprovider ?

== Introduction
For a particular `ServiceDefinition`, the developer is able to filter out (that is, hide from the connector user) individual operations that are declared in the WSDL file.

This filtering is necessary in order to exclude login/logout operations from the operations dropdown exposed to the application developer.
//todo: is it that certain operations in the service should not require login/logout, such as pinging the server

== Implementation

The set of excluded operations must be listed in the `ServiceDefinition`, so the operations that should be off-limits to the application developer are effectively ignored by DevKit in the metadata key retrieval process.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@WsdlServiceRetriever
    public ServiceDefinition getServiceDefinition() {
           ServiceDefinition service = new DefaultServiceDefinition(
                          "ServiceId", "tshirt", "tshirt.wsdl","TshirtService","TshirtServicePort");

           service.setExclusions(Arrays.asList("login", "logout"));

            // Exclusions can also be set as:
            // service.excludeOperation("myUnwantedOp");

            return service;
    }
----

Metadata keys that match the excluded operations are removed before metadata keys are returned through invocation of `getMetaDataKeys()`.
